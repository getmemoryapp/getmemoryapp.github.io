Maybe youâ€™re the kind of person that wants to know how old Justin Bieber is without going to a web page. Memory has you covered. You can build instant answers for your OWN content! 

You can tell Memory to automatically scrape information for you everyday and have it ready for you as an answer to a query. This can be your topline metric or the status of a CI build.
