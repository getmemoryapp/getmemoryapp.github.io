You can filter your searches by webapp. You can see content most recently opened for that app or search for specific content within that app.

It works for all the popular apps like Google docs, Jira, Github and Figma.

It works for your internal tools and dashboards and it works for obscure webapps that only you use.

It works for any website that you have opened in your browser!
