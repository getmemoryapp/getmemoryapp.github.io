You can filter your searches by webapp. For easy access this shows the most recent content for those webapps. 

It works with all the popular apps like Google docs, Jira, Github and Figma.

It works for your internal tools and it works for obscure webapps that only you use.

It lets you search through any webapp that you have opened in your browser!
