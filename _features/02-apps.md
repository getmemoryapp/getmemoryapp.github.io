You can filter your searches by webapp. You can see content most recently opened for that webapp or search for specific content within that webapp.

It works for all the popular apps like Google docs, Jira, Github and Figma.

It works for your internal tools and dashboards and it works for obscure webapps that only you use.

Memory lets you search through any webapp that you have opened in your browser!
